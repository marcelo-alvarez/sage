# Claude Code Orchestrator

A workflow system for Claude Code that guides development through focused agent phases with human approval gates.

## Overview

This orchestrator runs inside Claude Code conversations, directing Claude through a structured workflow: Explorer â†’ Criteria Gate â†’ Planner â†’ Coder â†’ Scribe â†’ Verifier â†’ Completion Gate. At decision gates, the workflow pauses and presents slash command options for you to control the next steps.

The key insight is separating the work phases (automated) from the decision points (human-controlled), while maintaining context isolation between agents through `/clear` commands and file-based handoffs.

## Quick Start

### Installation

Install Claude Orchestrator with a single command:

```bash
# Global installation (recommended) - available in all projects
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelo-alvarez/claude-orchestrator/main/install.sh | bash

# Initialize specific project directory
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelo-alvarez/claude-orchestrator/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --project-dir ~/my-project

# Project-local slash command (only available in this project)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelo-alvarez/claude-orchestrator/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --local-command

# Install from specific branch
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelo-alvarez/claude-orchestrator/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --branch feature/web-dashboard
```

### Installation Options

The `install.sh` script supports the following arguments:

| Argument | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `--project-dir DIR` | Initialize project files in specific directory | Current directory |
| `--branch BRANCH` | Install from specific git branch | `main` |
| `--local-command` | Install slash command locally in project instead of globally | Global installation |
| `--help` | Show detailed usage information | - |

**Installation Behavior:**
- **Runtime files** always install to `~/.claude-orchestrator/` (global)
- **Slash command** installs to `~/.claude/commands/` (global) or `.claude/commands/` (local)
- **Project files** (`.claude/tasks*.md`) are created in the specified project directory

### Generate Initial Tasks

Use the bootstrap command to analyze your project and generate initial tasks:
```
/orchestrate bootstrap
```

Claude will:
1. Analyze your codebase and project structure
2. Ask about your goals and priorities
3. Generate specific, actionable tasks
4. Create both `tasks.md` and `tasks-checklist.md` files

Alternatively, manually add tasks to `.claude/tasks-checklist.md`:
```markdown
- [ ] Fix authentication bug
- [ ] Add user profile feature
```

### Usage
Start a workflow in Claude Code:
```
/orchestrate start
```

Claude will work through the Explorer phase automatically, then pause at the Criteria Gate:
```
ðŸšª CRITERIA GATE: Human Review Required
â€¢ /orchestrate approve-criteria
â€¢ /orchestrate modify-criteria "your changes"  
â€¢ /orchestrate retry-explorer
```

Choose your path and the workflow continues based on your decision.

## Workflow

```
Explorer â”€â”€â†’ Criteria Gate â”€â”€â†’ Planner â”€â”€â†’ Coder â”€â”€â†’ Scribe â”€â”€â†’ Verifier â”€â”€â†’ Completion Gate
   â†“              â†“               â†“          â†“          â†“           â†“              â†“
analyzes     USER APPROVES     creates   implements  documents   verifies     USER APPROVES
  task         criteria         plan      changes      work       results      completion
```

**Automated phases:** Explorer, Planner, Coder, Scribe, Verifier run automatically and hand off to the next phase.

**Decision gates:** Criteria Gate and Completion Gate pause for human input via slash commands.

**Context isolation:** Each agent starts with `/clear` and communicates through files in `.agent-outputs/`.

### Meta-Orchestration (Advanced)

When developing the orchestrator itself, use meta-mode to prevent interference with your main development workflow:

```bash
# Use /morchestrate instead of /orchestrate when working on orchestrator code
/morchestrate start    # Uses .agent-outputs-meta/ and .claude-meta/
/morchestrate status   # Check meta workflow progress
/morchestrate clean    # Clean meta workflow files
```

**Meta-mode features:**
- **Complete isolation:** Uses separate directories (`.agent-outputs-meta/`, `.claude-meta/`)
- **Self-propagating:** All continuation commands automatically include `meta` flag
- **Prevents collision:** Testing/development won't interfere with main workflow
- **Identical functionality:** Same agents and workflow, just isolated namespace

## Commands

### Main Workflow Commands

**Workflow control:**
- `/orchestrate bootstrap` - Generate initial tasks for your project
- `/orchestrate start` - Start fresh workflow  
- `/orchestrate continue` - Continue to next agent
- `/orchestrate status` - Show current progress
- `/orchestrate clean` - Reset outputs

**Gate decisions:**
- `/orchestrate approve-criteria` - Accept criteria and continue
- `/orchestrate modify-criteria "changes"` - Edit criteria based on feedback
- `/orchestrate approve-completion` - Mark task complete
- `/orchestrate retry-explorer` - Restart from exploration phase
- `/orchestrate retry-from-planner` - Restart from planning phase
- `/orchestrate retry-from-coder` - Restart from coding phase
- `/orchestrate retry-from-verifier` - Re-verify only

### Meta-Orchestration Commands

When working on orchestrator development, use these isolated commands:

**Meta workflow control:**
- `/morchestrate bootstrap` - Generate tasks in meta mode
- `/morchestrate start` - Start workflow in isolated meta mode
- `/morchestrate continue` - Continue meta workflow
- `/morchestrate status` - Show meta workflow progress
- `/morchestrate clean` - Reset meta workflow outputs

**Meta gate decisions:**
- `/morchestrate approve-criteria` - Accept criteria in meta mode
- `/morchestrate modify-criteria "changes"` - Edit criteria in meta mode
- `/morchestrate approve-completion` - Mark meta task complete

### Custom Environment Configuration

The orchestrator supports project-specific environment setup through optional configuration files in your project root.

#### Environment Files

- **`.orchestrator.env`** - Simple environment variable exports
- **`load_env.sh`** - Complex shell script for advanced environment setup

#### Loading Behavior

Before executing orchestrator commands, the system automatically sources environment files in this priority order:

1. `.orchestrator.env` (if exists)
2. `load_env.sh` (if exists and no `.orchestrator.env` found)
3. System defaults (if no environment files found)

This allows you to customize the development environment on a per-project basis without modifying the global orchestrator installation.

## Architecture

The orchestrator is a state machine where:
- Python script (`.claude/orchestrate.py`) manages workflow state and generates agent instructions
- Claude Code executes the instructions within the conversation
- Files in `.agent-outputs/` provide context between isolated agent phases
- Human input via slash commands controls workflow branching at decision points

## Design Principles

**Separation of concerns:** Python manages workflow state, Claude does the development work, human makes decisions.

**Context isolation:** Each agent gets fresh context to avoid pollution and maintain focus.

**File-based communication:** Agents pass information through structured files rather than conversation history.

**Human control:** Decision gates prevent runaway automation and ensure human oversight of critical choices.

## Advanced Features

### Custom Agent Creation

The orchestrator supports custom agent types beyond the built-in ones (explorer, planner, coder, scribe, verifier). You can create specialized agents for your specific workflows.

#### Creating a Custom Agent

1. **Create the agent directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.claude-orchestrator/agents/my-custom-agent
   ```

2. **Create the agent template file:**
   ```bash
   # ~/.claude-orchestrator/agents/my-custom-agent/CLAUDE.md
   ```

3. **Define the agent template:**
   ```markdown
   You are the MY-CUSTOM-AGENT agent.

   TASK: {{task}}

   YOUR ONLY RESPONSIBILITIES:
   1. Perform specialized analysis
   2. Generate custom reports
   3. Write findings to .agent-outputs/custom-analysis.md

   FORBIDDEN ACTIONS:
   - Modifying source code
   - Making implementation decisions
   - Creating unrelated files
   ```

**Note:** The orchestrator automatically adds completion commands - do not include them in your templates.

#### Template Format Requirements

**Required Elements:**
- **Work section:** Description of agent responsibilities and tasks
- **Variables:** Use `{{variable}}` format for substitution (e.g., `{{task}}`)

**Best Practices:**
- Define clear responsibilities section
- Specify forbidden actions to maintain focus
- Avoid including completion commands (auto-generated)
- Use descriptive agent names

#### Variable Substitution

Custom agents support variable substitution:
- `{{task}}` - The current task being worked on
- `{{project_name}}` - Project name (for some agents)
- `{{custom_var}}` - Any custom variables you define

Variables are automatically detected and can be passed when creating agent instances.

#### Integration with Workflows

Custom agents are automatically discovered and can be:
- Listed in available agents
- Integrated into workflow sequences
- Used in orchestration commands

The system validates custom templates to ensure they have required fields and proper structure.

### Workflow Customization

You can customize the workflow sequence by creating a `.claude/workflow-config.json` file in your project:

```json
{
  "sequence": ["explorer", "criteria_gate", "planner", "custom-agent", "coder", "scribe", "verifier", "completion_gate"],
  "gates": {
    "criteria": {
      "after": "explorer",
      "options": [
        "Execute the slash-command `/orchestrate approve-criteria` - Accept and continue",
        "Execute the slash-command `/orchestrate modify-criteria` - Modify criteria first"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Agent Overrides

Override built-in agent behavior by creating a `.claude/agent-config.json` file in your project:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "coder": {
      "work_section": "Custom coder instructions here...",
      "completion_phrase": "CODER COMPLETE",
      "primary_objective": "Complete coding work according to responsibilities"
    }
  }
}
```
