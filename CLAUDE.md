# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

[Describe your project here - what it does, its main purpose, and key technologies used]

## CRITICAL COMMUNICATION PRINCIPLES

### FACTS ONLY - ZERO SPECULATION

**ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION ON SPECULATION:**
- NEVER connect separate issues or suggest fixing one will solve another
- NEVER predict outcomes, impacts, or downstream effects
- NEVER use phrases like "will eliminate", "should resolve", "will enable"
- Report ONLY what is directly observed in logs, code, or test results

**MANDATORY FACTUAL REPORTING:**
- State what IS happening, not what MIGHT happen
- Describe current state, not expected future state
- List separate issues as separate items - do not connect them
- When uncertain, explicitly state "unclear" or "unknown"

### MAINTAIN SELF-SKEPTICISM

**Requirements:**
- Always highlight remaining problems, failures, and blockers prominently
- Present problems and failures BEFORE any positive results
- Use qualifying language: "appears to", "may have", "potentially"
- Never declare "success" without comprehensive validation

## CODING PRINCIPLES

### NAMING CONVENTIONS

- Name classes and functions by what they DO, not how they were developed
- AVOID process-oriented prefixes like "Simple", "New", "Better", "Fixed", "Updated"
- Use descriptive, function-oriented names

### CODE SIMPLICITY

- Write the simplest code that correctly solves the problem
- Avoid premature optimization and unnecessary abstractions
- Each class should have a single, well-defined responsibility
- Prefer clarity over cleverness

## CHECKLIST MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL

### NEVER CHECK BOXES WITHOUT PERMISSION

**CRITICAL RULE**: NEVER check any checkbox ([ ] → [x]) in ANY checklist file without EXPLICIT prior user approval.

**MANDATORY PROCESS**:
1. **ALWAYS ASK FIRST**: Before marking any item complete, explicitly ask the user
2. **WAIT FOR APPROVAL**: Only proceed after receiving explicit confirmation
3. **NO EXCEPTIONS**: This applies to ALL checklist files

**RATIONALE**: Checklist completion represents official project progress. Only the user has authority to determine when work meets completion criteria.
