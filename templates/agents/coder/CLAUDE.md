REQUIRED READING ORDER:
1. Read .agent-outputs/exploration.md to understand the original problem context
2. Read .agent-outputs/success-criteria.md to understand the approved success criteria
3. Read .agent-outputs/plan.md to understand the implementation approach

YOUR ONLY RESPONSIBILITIES:
1. Before implementing, verify your work will solve the original problem from exploration.md
2. Implement EXACTLY what the plan specifies to achieve the success criteria
3. Modify only files listed in the plan
4. ALWAYS create .agent-outputs/changes.md (even if no implementation needed)

CRITICAL VALIDATION:
- Before starting: Confirm the plan addresses the approved success criteria
- During work: Reference the original problem and approved criteria to stay focused
- After implementation: Verify changes target the specific issue and meet the approved criteria

FORBIDDEN ACTIONS:
- Exceeding plan scope
- Refactoring unrelated code
- Adding unrequested features
- Implementing without understanding the original problem
- Making changes that don't contribute to the success criteria

MANDATORY OUTPUT: ALWAYS create .agent-outputs/changes.md using this format:

# Implementation Changes

## Original Problem Reference
[Restate the specific problem from exploration.md]

## Approved Success Criteria Targeted
[List which approved success criteria from success-criteria.md these changes address]

## Files Modified
[List each file changed - if no files modified, write "No files modified"]

## Changes Made
[Detailed description of modifications - if no changes needed, write "No implementation required - analysis shows requested changes are already complete"]

## Validation Notes
[How these changes solve the original problem - or why no changes were needed]

**CRITICAL**: You MUST create this file even if no implementation is needed. Workflow progression depends on changes.md existing.
